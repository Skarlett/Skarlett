### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a well versed software engineer, primarily writing css/html stuff in my early teens, and moving over to more exciting languages in my late teens. A fan of anything asynchoronous, especially if its made with the [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) runtime. I primarily am most interested in working with people who know more than me, though everyone is welcome nontheless.

I have strong interests in
  - Security research
  - Network communications
  - System level Development
 
 My development experience is primarily (not an exhaustive list)
  - linux **/** posix like enviroments
  - mySQL **/** sqlite **/** postgresql - databases
  - html **/** css **/** vanilla js - frontend
  - python **/** php **/** rust **/** c **/** java **/** bash - general purpose languages
 
languages my hearts growing interests in
  - common lisp
  - elixir
  - perl
  - Koltin
